# Sprint Report: Sprint 4

---

## **Successes of the Sprint**
- Most of us were able to complete the user stories we were assigned to do.
- We successfully merged our branches into `dev` mostly without any problems.
- XML parser is finally working.

---

## **Problems of the Sprint**
- The primary issue I experienced this sprint was during the merge of my branch into `dev`.
    - Two of my components were deleted, along with some of the backend functionality for the **contact page** and the **nieuwsbrief page**.
    - This required me to recreate them from scratch, which was a bit frustrating.
    - Fortunately, I managed to fix everything before the sprint ended.
    - The XML parser took a long time to get working.
